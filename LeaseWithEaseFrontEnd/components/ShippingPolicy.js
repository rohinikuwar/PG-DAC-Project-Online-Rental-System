                            Please note that you should ensure the entry of delivery vehicle inside the premises. Most of the times, it is not allowed to park the delivery vehicles on road.

                            <b>Who deals with labor (hamaali) union and transport union issues?</b><br />
                            RentoMojo deals with transport union at loading and unloading area. However, if there is labor (hamaali) union issues at your location and they do not allow us to unload at your place, you have to deal with them. In worst cases, we will take the items back without delivering and we will bear the logistics cost. Chances of labor union issues are very less.
